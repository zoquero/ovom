Some things to be done:

* Flag files to trigger actions like: 1) pause inventory gathering 2) restart inventory gathering 3) launch new inventory gathering
* Dao: pending testing update sqlPerfCounterInfoUpdate
* aggressively cache retrieved objects at OPerformance::getLatestPerformance()
* aggressively cache OPerformance::getPerfManager()
* when should DBI::finish be called?
* getting hardware alarms
