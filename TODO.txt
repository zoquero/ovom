Some things to be done:

* Bug: looks like the PerfCounterInfo with a key changes between loops and web haved developed asserting that it would never change.
* Flag files to trigger actions like: 1) pause inventory gathering 2) restart inventory gathering 3) launch new inventory gathering
* Dao: PerfMetric no fully implemented nor fully tested
* Dao: pending testing update sqlPerfCounterInfoUpdate
* apply timeout to the calls in OPerformance::getLatestPerformance() after getting perfManager and before calling QueryPerf, for getting counterInfo, available perfMetricIds, ...
* aggressively cache retrieved objects at OPerformance::getLatestPerformance()
* aggressively cache OPerformance::getPerfManager()
* mocking PerfManager and perfCounterInfo to work offline
* Charset problem: When a folder has non-ascii characters the comparation says that it's different. Appears correctly on console, so it looks like a DB configuration error.
* when should DBI::finish be called?
* log rotation
* getting hardware alarms
