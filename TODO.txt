Some things to be done:

* Write PerfMetrics to csv files, to be able to understand the graphs without having to access the database
* Pending solve bug on Interpolation: 'Argument "" isn't numeric in subtraction (-) at /usr/share/perl5/Math/Derivative.pm line 105" : Probably we are trying to interpolate with empty values, we should clear the array.
* Flag files to trigger actions like: 1) pause inventory gathering 2) restart inventory gathering 3) launch new inventory gathering
* Dao: pending testing update sqlPerfCounterInfoUpdate
* aggressively cache retrieved objects at OPerformance::getLatestPerformance()
* aggressively cache OPerformance::getPerfManager()
* when should DBI::finish be called?
* getting hardware alarms
