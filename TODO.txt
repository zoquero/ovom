* loadEntityById and loadEntityByMoRef should return reference instead of object
* Bug: In current implementation parents are always Folders. Wrong! "parent" is an object, with type = Folder | Datacenter , at least. As a first correction we could just look for paren'ts mo_ref in Folder list and if it search fails we can than look for that mo_ref in Datacenter list. It's really simpler to deal with parents in code as simply a simple mo_ref. I don't know if the mo_ref namespace is the same for all the objects...
* log rotation
* getting hardware alarms
* DBI tunning (review prepared statements, caching, ...)
