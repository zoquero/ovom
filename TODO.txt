Things to be done:

* Move OPerfCounterInfo::getCsvRowHeader and OPerfCounterInfo::toHtmlTableRow to OWwwLibs

* Performance improvement: Now groupInfo filters when searching alarms is not implemented in SQL nor in the control, it's implemented in OWwwLibs::respondShowAlarmReport() OWwwLibs::getHtmlTableRow(). To improve the search time it should be implemented at least in the control.

* We're troubleshooting that there's no perfData for some entities ("No PerfEntityMetricCSV for " entries on logs)
** It also happens with /usr/share/doc/vmware-vcli/samples/performance/performance.pl if you change it to show performance for several VMs on a loop.
** I found these entries in vCSA's /storage/log/vmware/vpxd/vpxd-XXX.log :
2017-10-28T15:03:50.318Z error vpxd[7F0612850700] [Originator@6876 sub=MoHost] Response from host host-74427 is null, even though no error received
2017-10-28T15:03:50.318Z error vpxd[7F0612850700] [Originator@6876 sub=MoHost] [HandleAsyncQueryPerfResultsDoFinally] The RPC for host host-74427 completed with status code 3
** I've tried with this KB: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2107096?language=en_US but it doesn't help

* BUG: When there are gaps in perfData files:
$ time ./picker.pl 
Use of uninitialized value in multiplication (*) at /usr/share/perl5/Math/Derivative.pm line 123.

Zero interval in spline data.
 at /home/agalindo/workspace/ovom/OPerformance.pm line 1701.

* $allCountersByGIKey{$aGroupInfo} = $aPci (hash from groupInfo to array of PerfCounterInfo)
  maybe should be moved to $allCountersByGIKey{$aGroupInfo}{$aPciKey} = $aPci  (hash (keys=groupInfo) of hashes ($aPciKey => $aPci)

* Improve performance: log: "Perf data saved" and just next: "Reading perfData from file". At the least the "latest" file can be cached and one file read can be save per entity

* Set that if perfpicker.groupInfo.* are empty it means that you want all PerfMetrics. OPerformance::getDesiredGroupInfoForEntity() and OPerformance::filterPerfMetricIds()

* Move all the conf files (ovom.conf  secrets.conf  thresholds/PerfMetricId.thresholds.csv) to a new ./conf directory

* Housekeepings to be called by cron:
** remove old graph files (csv and png)
** compress &| remove rotated log files

* OPerformance::doRrdb:
** RRDB is not working fine or wrong configuration: there's just data until "day" stage, no data in week, month nor year stages
** We must calculate cubic spline interpolation just for 4 surrounding points. Calculating with more points just enlarges the calculus duration without adding substantial accuracy

** We may cache available perfMetricIds for entities

* Alerts :
** Thresholds: Store in confFile or DB?
** Custom thresholds per each entity 
** Save 'latest data'  in the PerfMetricId object and at BD
** Create a new AlertHistory table and push there the alerts

* Show alerts in webUI:
** 'current alerts'
** Alerts history

* Show in each entity in WebUI:
** Current overall state (colour)
** Current alerts list
** History of alerts

* NRPE check:
** For a concrete counterId & instance (by mo-ref | by type&name)
*** thresholds
*** optional if increasing (default) or decreasing
** General: Is there any alert for any indicator of this entity? (any of those indicators that has thresholds)

* Alert hook for:
** Nagios Passive checks
** SNMP trap

* refresh session in each hit

* improve menuCanvas in webUI to allow 'go to previous entity'

* Flag files to trigger actions like: 1) pause inventory gathering 2) restart inventory gathering 3) launch new inventory gathering
* Dao: pending testing update sqlPerfCounterInfoUpdate
* aggressively cache retrieved objects at OPerformance::getLatestPerformance()
* aggressively cache OPerformance::getPerfManager()
* when should DBI::finish be called?
* getting hardware alarms
