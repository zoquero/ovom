Things to be done:

* OPerformance::doRrdb:
** RRDB is not working fine or wrong configuration: there's just data until "day" stage, no data in week, month nor year stages
** We must calculate cubic spline interpolation just for 4 surrounding points. Calculating with more points just enlarges the calculus duration without adding substantial accuracy

** We may cache available perfMetricIds for entities

* Alerts :
** Thresholds: Store in confFile or DB?
** Custom thresholds per each entity 
** Save 'latest data'  in the PerfMetricId object and at BD
** Create a new AlertHistory table and push there the alerts

* Show alerts in webUI:
** 'current alerts'
** Alerts history

* Show in each entity in WebUI:
** Current overall state (colour)
** Current alerts list
** History of alerts

* NRPE check:
** For a concrete counterId & instance (by mo-ref | by type&name)
*** thresholds
*** optional if increasing (default) or decreasing
** General: Is there any alert for any indicator of this entity? (any of those indicators that has thresholds)

* Alert hook for:
** Nagios Passive checks
** SNMP trap

* refresh session in each hit

* improve menuCanvas in webUI to allow 'go to previous entity'

* Flag files to trigger actions like: 1) pause inventory gathering 2) restart inventory gathering 3) launch new inventory gathering
* Dao: pending testing update sqlPerfCounterInfoUpdate
* aggressively cache retrieved objects at OPerformance::getLatestPerformance()
* aggressively cache OPerformance::getPerfManager()
* when should DBI::finish be called?
* getting hardware alarms
