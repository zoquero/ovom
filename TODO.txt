Some things to be done:

* aggressively cache retrieved objects at OPerformance::getLatestPerformance()
* aggressively cache OPerformance::getPerfManager()
* mocking PerfManager and perfCounterInfo to work offline
* Charset problem: When a folder has non-ascii characters the comparation says that it's different. Appears correctly on console, so it looks like a DB configuration error.
* when should DBI::finish be called?
* log rotation
* getting hardware alarms
